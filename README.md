# JSXaal

JSXaal is a JavaScript-based viewer for XAAL, the
[eXtensible Algorithm Animation Language](http://xaal.org).

## Demo

There is a working demo running at
http://demo.villekaravirta.com/jsxaal/doc/example.html .

## Basic installation

1. Clone this git repository.

   `git clone git@github.com:atilante/jsxaal.git`   

2. To run JSXaal locally, you need a minimal web server that can host files
   over HTTP. One easy way is to install [Python](https://www.python.org).

3. Run Python web server at the JSXaal source code directory.
   `python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1`

4. Open the following web page in your browser:
   http://localhost:8000/

5. Navigate to `doc/example.html`


## Development

Building the JavaScript requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and
[rake-compiler](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler/).

The following command combines `*.js` files from `src/` into `dist/jsxaal-core.js`.

`rake dist`

Note that the file `Rakefile` is the currently working version of older
`Rakefile.original`. The latter has the following problems when tested in 2021.
- the `test` rake target is broken (missing files)
- `bin/jsmin.rb` causes an ArgumentError.
- [jsmin](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/jsmin) could be replaced
  with something else.

For quick development, one can have the Python web server running at one
terminal and build the JavaScript at the same time on another terminal.
